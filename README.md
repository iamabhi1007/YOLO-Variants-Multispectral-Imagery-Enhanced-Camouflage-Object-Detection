Enhanced Camouflage Object Detection in Multispectral Imagery using Advanced YOLO Variants. 
Abstract. This study investigates the efficacy of advanced YOLO (You Only Look Once) variants, specifically YOLOv5, v7, v8, and v9, in detecting con-cealed camouflaged objects within multispectral imagery. Utilizing the Altum-PT multispectral camera, a comprehensive dataset of multispectral images was cap-tured and preprocessed using techniques such as fusion, false coloring, and pansharpening to enhance image quality and extract relevant features. The per-formance of these YOLO models was evaluated through extensive experiments across diverse environmental contexts. The results demonstrate that YOLO vari-ants, especially when combined with Slicing Aided Hyper Inference (SAHI), ex-hibit robust detection capabilities, with precision ranging from 93.9% to 98.2% and recall varying from 80.2% to 98.1%. Despite variations in performance met-rics due to architectural nuances and training methodologies, all models show promise for applications in surveillance and security. The implementation of SAHI successfully rectified false detections, improving prediction accuracy. This study contributes to advancing concealed object detection techniques and under-scores the potential of deep learning in enhancing surveillance capabilities.

Conclusions
The study highlights the effectiveness of YOLO variants from v5 to v9 for concealed object detection in multispectral imagery. Through experimentation, it is shown that these models accurately identify targets across diverse conditions. The detection im-ages affirm their reliability, with each variant displaying varying performance metrics due to architectural nuances and training methodologies. The novelty of the research lies in the implementation of SAHI with v5, v8 was done successfully in rectifying false detection and confidently predicting camouflage objects with an additional 10 % accuracy compared to without SAHI. The use of fusion, pansharpening, and false coloring in preprocessing uniquely strengthened the modelsâ€™ ability to capture critical details, supporting applications in security and surveillance. Despite all the differ-ences, the chosen models exhibit promise for surveillance and security applications. This study contributes to advancing concealed object detection and underscores the potential of deep learning in security contexts. The outcomes of these studies give way for future research and should focus on optimizing hyperparameters, incorporat-ing more data, and exploring advanced architectures to enhance detection capabilities.
